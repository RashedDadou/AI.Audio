AI.Audio: Powered by vocal cord technology that mimics the human voice, it can change your voice from that of a baby to that of a 90-year-old man. It uses sounds to react to facial and body movements without consuming any cache space.  x.AI launched the Ani &amp; Rudi character app after the release of Grok4, inspired by my idea.
